# About {{site.title}}

{{site.title}} is a free tool to help Disabled people in Aotearoa access data and develop data skills to support their work.

You'll find a range of data about Disabled people and disability issues, and resources to help you understand and use the data.

Can't find what you're looking for or have feedback for us on the site? Email us at <help@figure.nz> and let us know what you need. We especially welcome feedback on accessibility needs.

## Who made this?

{{site.title}} is brought to you by [Figure.NZ](https://figure.nz). This project is supported by our friends at [Stats NZ](https://stats.govt.nz). We are very grateful for both their support and their shared passion for Disabled people's wellbeing through access to quality data.

### Figure.NZ

Figure.NZ is a charity dedicated to getting the people of New Zealand using data to thrive. 

We do this because we want to live in a country where everyone can take part in creating a delightful New Zealand. We believe we can progress towards that by helping everyone in our country understand the things they care about so they can make great choices.

We’re committed to making New Zealand’s public, aggregate data available through our website — for free, for everyone, forever — because we believe data is not just for experts, and its true value lies in people using it in their day to day lives.

We’ve put data about New Zealand from over 175 different organisations into one easily searchable place, where more than 43,000 charts and datasets are available.

Now that we’ve established the technology, systems, and processes needed to make our country’s data easily available, we’re focused on getting it into the hands of New Zealanders, and providing the support they need to make good use of it.
